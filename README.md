# A Case Study of Brazil’s Government Owned Instant Payments System- PIX
## Overview and Origin
* The name of the system in this case study is PIX. PIX is an instant payments system that is designed and owned by the Central Bank of Brazil. Although the system had its launch in November 2020, the Central Bank had been preparing market participants for its release for a long time. Central Bank of Brazil is the monetary policy authority of the Brazilian government. The Central Bank is responsible for the money supply in the economy and keeping inflation at targeted levels while also being responsible for clearing payments through its systems. 
* The Central Bank launched PIX, the instant payments system, due to the need in the financial markets for low-cost, efficient, transparent and fast money transfer system.
Brazil's banking sector is highly concentrated among a handful of large banks with limited reach to the population working in the informal economy.  The idea for PIX came from governments desire to be able to regulate new payment arrangements as a result of the electronization of commerce. The Central Bank wants to encourage other instant payment systems to join the Brazilian fintech market and increase the competition in the markets. Therefore, in order to lead the markets, the Central Bank took the initiative to launch the first official government-owned fintech system in Brazil. The Central Bank governor gave numerous talks and made numerous announcements on this initiative to market participants across the globe, most recently he gave a speech about the fintech industry’s evolving nature in Brazil to the U.S. Brazilian Chamber of Commerce.
## Business Activities:
* The specific financial problem that this instant payments project aims to solve is the lack of transperancy in the payments market in Brazil, where informal employment is a key concern of the government. By introducing this regulated system, the government will be able to keep better track of payments and open the market for regulated and approved instant payment systems where they will act as regulated mechanisms for money transfer. Through this aim, the Central Bank will have a better control and rule over the money supply in the economy and will be able to incorporate transactions under informal employment into its analysis by gaining more detailed knowledge on it.
* PIX's intended customers are anyone in the Brazilian markets regardless of employment status or gender. The market size is extremely large due to the fact that the system aims to be used by almost every person of age in Brazil who are capable of using this technology. The Central Bank aimed this technology to be very user-friendly to be able to reach older populations. It is expected that relatively younger portion of the population will be more easily incorporated into the system while for older populations, it may take more time and education.
* At this point, there cannot be any other competitors of this size for PIX, since the unfair advantage that this system has is that it is backed by the government authority behind it. However, PIX is not meant to be a large competitor in the economy. In fact, by design, as mentioned earlier, is that it will open the market for other participants through government leadership. Through this program, the governmnet does not intend to crowd out the market by eliminating market competition. Instead, the Central Bank aims to lead the way into a fintech market with this initiative. However, the govenrment, by employing this technology is improving its competition standing with regards to other Central Banks and governments through showing its adaptability.
* PIX is a Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) system in which transactions are settled as soon as they are processed, on a one-to-one basis. Once settled, transactions are final and irrevocable. In order to make sure that the instant payments scheme is working correctly, the system was tested through a "homologation cycle", which required all participants to test the operationality of the platforms such as the Instant Payments System itself and the Transaction Accounts Identifier Directory as well as the final customer experience.
## Landscape:
* The domain that the PIX system is in is isntant payments but it can also be considered as a regulatory fintech domain since PIX is owned and operated by the Central Bank of Brazil, the regulatory branch of the Brazilian government on monetary policy. The landscape is very limited in Brazil due to the new emergence of this domain.
* This domain is
